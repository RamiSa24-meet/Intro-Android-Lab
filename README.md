# Intro to Android Studio Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn to implement the essentials of Android Studio and working with Java & XML!  

By the end of this lab, you will have a template of a signin page.  

## Instructions:

In this lab, we'll be creating a sign in page using TextView, EditText & Button!  

1. Create and set up a new `Android Studio` project:
    - Go to new -> new project -> Empty Activity.
    - Make sure your code is in **Java**.

2. In your XML file:
    1. Change the layout to `linear layout`.
          - Don't forget the linear layout attributes.
    2. Add:
          - A `TextView` that says SignIn.
          - Two `EditTexts` for email & password, **hint:** Don't forget the difference between hint and text.
          - A `Button` that says submit.
          - **Don't forget to add ids**

3. In your Java file:
      1. Connect the views from the `XML file` to the `Java file`.
      2. Set an `onclick listener` for the submit button:
        - When the Button is clicked:
          1. Set the text of the EditTexts to be empty again
          2. using Toast, a message to the user should say "form submitted".
